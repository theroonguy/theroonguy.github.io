<h2>The Var City Bridge</h2>

<p>
    This was the first of four environment artworks I made for a D&D campaign with two of my close friends that took place on essentially a scaled-up, fantastical version of UMD's campus. The bridge was once a major highway connecting the continent of Testuda (the campus) to the outside world, and a city developed on the other end called Var (a reference to the off-campus apartment Varsity). However, through an act of terrorism, bombs had been planted and set off, destroying the connection and isolating Testuda from its most valuable partner.
    <br><br>
    Who could have done this, and why? It was this question which sparked the quest for our campaign.
    <br><br>
    The artwork itself was nearly entirely created in Blender, aside from a few color grading tweaks and film grain for that sweet, sweet <i>cinematic</i> look. The centerpiece of the frame, the turbulent waters, despite looking difficult to create, were created with not much more than a simple Blender modifier, aptly named the "Ocean" modifier. The material for it? The built-in glass shader. Even the foam was a simple button in the modifier, linked to a blend between the glass shader and an opaque white. Nothing too fancy. In fact, the trees were simply transparent PNGs taken from google and aligned to always face the camera. Blender really took care of the hard work for me in this shot.
    <br><br>
    I actually began work on this piece weeks prior to our first session, after shoving to the side a cleaned-off plate of food from south campus dining hall as the DM eagerly scraped together the half-baked visions and concepts that eventually made up the world across the table from me, and the other player sketched out our characters. We decided then, amidst the clattering of dishes and with the looming stress of our first university final exams ahead, that we would each design our own parts of our world and only reveal it to the others when it was time. The DM would design the story, the other player would portray our in-game characters, and I would envision the world. And so I did, without any knowledge of how it would be used, and solely based off of a few hints.
    <br><br>
    There are not many moments that feel as special to me in recent years as moments like those did. In our last weeks of the semester, collaborating on this universe became our passion, and the dining halls became our iconic workspace, and we would trade ideas during ENES100 and tease out hints from each other's creations in the meantime. After the longest, most stressful, and emotional 3 months of my life, it was more than anything I could have asked for. Now, I just had to wait until I could show them...

<h2>The JMP Warehouse</h2>

<p>
    What better setting could there be for a campaign born and raised in ENES100 than the building itself? Suddenly, ideas began to sprout of incorporating OTV's into the story, scaled up along with the building itself into monstrous automated vehicles, armed with various machinery and actuators designed for tasks much like their real counterparts. As one of the older buildings on campus, the area was destined to be a well-used and even decrepit factory of what once produced these vehicles en masse.
    <br><br>
    In this particular scene, I chose to install a metal-forming system that would have manufactured steel and iron components using molds. I researched industrial-age factories, and noticed the massive melting and pouring buckets used in steel mills, and I immediately decided to use them as a subject.
