title: "My node network"

Welcome to my blog! Kind of. Here, you'll find my random writings from my life, hobbies, stories, and other various thoughts, stored in what I'll call **nodes**. Why nodes? Well, the way I see it, standard blogs are treated as entries, inextricably linked to the date and time of its writing. What if, instead, my writings *lived* with me, connected by topic and relation rather than by chronology? I'm just that unique.
