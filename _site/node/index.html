      <p>Yes, I have a blog. I know, very exciting. One version of me would argue it’s a “digital garden,” an evolving landscape of both trimmed bushes and tangled vines made of thoughts and stories. Or a journal. Call it what you want. Just not a diary, dear god. I will henceforth name it my “Digital Garth.”</p>

<p>You might wonder what a “garth” is, unless you’re British. I suppose it’s a lot like a garden, but… secluded, private, enclosed by structure and order. Despite never having heard the term before, it’s a picture I feel I’ve lived in again and again. When I was in middle school, I was obsessed with Sherlock and how he solved his cases with his so-called “mind palace.” It’s a memory technique that hijacks our wildly accurate spatial memory with strange mental images to remember incredible amounts of information. And so, in my bedroom closet, I scribbled out a floor plan of my very own mind palace, with regions dedicated to varying topics. And in the center was such an enclosed garden, with a single bench planted at the roots of a tree. And there was my Garth.</p>

<p>Of course, I didn’t know how to actually use a mind palace. I sat on that bench once and then promptly fell asleep. But nonetheless: the mental image has remained with me. And it’s always felt safe. Once, during the pandemic, I was inspired by a webseries and imagined a scene I wanted to retreat to, a way to escape my room. With my limited Blender skills at the time, this is how I attempted to recreate that image:</p>

<p><a href="/img/art/inbetween.png"><img class="simple-border" src="/img/art/inbetween.png" style="display: flex; margin: 0 auto; width: 70%; height: auto;" /></a></p>

<p>So, here we are. Am I naming this a “Garth” because it sounds silly? Probably. Definitely. But like every joke, there’s a shred of sincerity embedded within. Have a look around, and enjoy what bits and pieces of my life you want to.</p>
